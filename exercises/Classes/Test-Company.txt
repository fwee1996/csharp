Expand on the Company class code by
Adding an Employees property (Its type should be List<Employee>)
Setting the value of Employees in the constructor as a new List<Employee> (News Flash: Declaring a property gives it an initial vlaue of null). This will allow you to add newly created employees to the Employees list in the final step below.

//The Company class should also have a ListEmployees() method which writes a string to the console about each employee, such as "Jane Doe works for Acme, Inc. as Lion Tamer since 3/23/15."


//method
public void ListEmployee(employee){                                       //----------------dont forget void!

    Console.WriteLine($"{employee.FirstName} {employee.LastName} works for {Name} as {employee.Title} since {employee.StartDate}.")

 }
    }
}
